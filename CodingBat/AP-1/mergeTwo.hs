{-From https://codingbat.com/prob/p139150
Start with two arrays of strings, A and B, each with its elements in alphabetical order
and without duplicates. Return a new array containing the first N elements from the two
arrays. The result array should be in alphabetical order and without duplicates. A and
B will both have a length which is N or more. The best "linear" solution makes a single
pass over A and B, taking advantage of the fact that they are in alphabetical order,
copying elements directly to the new array.
