{-From https://codingbat.com/prob/p148138
We have an array of heights, representing the altitude along a walking trail. Given start/end
indexes into the array, return the sum of the changes for a walk beginning at the start
index and ending at the end index. For example, with the heights {5, 3, 6, 7, 2} and
start=2, end=4 yields a sum of 1 + 5 = 6. The start end end index will both be valid
indexes into the array with start <= end.
