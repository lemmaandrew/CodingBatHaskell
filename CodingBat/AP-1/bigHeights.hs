{-From https://codingbat.com/prob/p197710
(A variation on the sumHeights problem.) We have an array of heights, representing the
altitude along a walking trail. Given start/end indexes into the array, return the number
of "big" steps for a walk starting at the start index and ending at the end index. We'll
say that    step is big if it is 5 or more up or down. The start end end index will
both be valid indexes into the array with start <= end.
