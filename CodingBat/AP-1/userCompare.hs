{- From https://codingbat.com/prob/p143482
We have data for two users, A and B, each with a String name and an int id. The goal 
is to order the users such as for sorting. Return -1 if A comes before B, 1 if A comes 
after B, and 0 if they are the same. Order first by the string names, and then by the 
id numbers if the names are the same. Note: with Strings str1.compareTo(str2) returns 
an int value which is negative/0/positive to indicate how str1 is ordered to str2 (the 
value is not limited to -1/0/1). (On the AP, there would be two User objects, but here 
the code simply takes the two strings and two ints directly. The code logic is the same.)
