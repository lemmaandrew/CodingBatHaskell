We'll say that a positive int n is "endy" if it is in the range 0..10 or 90..100 (inclusive).
Given an array of positive ints, return a new array of length "count" containing the first
endy numbers from the original array. Decompose out a separate isEndy(int n) method to
test if a number is endy. The original array will contain at least "count" endy numbers.
