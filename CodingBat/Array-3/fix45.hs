{-From https://codingbat.com/prob/p125819
(This is a slightly harder version of the fix34 problem.) Return an array that contains
exactly the same numbers as the given array, but rearranged so that every 4 is immediately
followed by a 5. Do not move the 4's, but every other number may move. The array contains
the same number of 4's and 5's, and every 4 has a number after it that is not a 4.
In this version, 5's may appear anywhere in the original array.
