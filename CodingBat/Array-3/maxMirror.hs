{-From https://codingbat.com/prob/p196409
We'll say that a "mirror" section in an array is a group of contiguous elements such
that somewhere in the array, the same group appears in reverse order. For example, the
largest mirror section in {1, 2, 3, 8, 9, 3, 2, 1} is length 3 (the {1, 2, 3} part).
Return the size of the largest mirror section found in the given array.
