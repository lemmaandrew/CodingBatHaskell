{- From https://codingbat.com/prob/p184030
Given an \"out\" string length 4, such as \"<<>>\", and a word, return a new string 
where the word is in the middle of the out string, e.g. \"<<word>>\". Note: use str.substring(i, 
j) to extract the String starting at index i and going up to but not including index 
j.
