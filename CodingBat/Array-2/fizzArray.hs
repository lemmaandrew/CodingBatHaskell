Given a number n, create and return a new int array of length n, containing the numbers 
0, 1, 2, ... n-1. The given n may be 0, in which case just return a length 0 array. 
You do not need a separate if-statement for the length-0 case; the for-loop should naturally 
execute 0 times in that case, so it just works. The syntax to make a new int array is: new 
int[desired_length]    (See also: FizzBuzz Code)
