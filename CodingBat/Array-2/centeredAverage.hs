{-From https://codingbat.com/prob/p136585
Return the "centered" average of an array of ints, which we'll say is the mean average
of the values, except ignoring the largest and smallest values in the array. If there
are multiple copies of the smallest value, ignore just one copy, and likewise for the
largest value. Use int division to produce the final average. You may assume that the
array is length 3 or more.
