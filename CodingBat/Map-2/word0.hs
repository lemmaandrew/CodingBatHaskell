{- From https://codingbat.com/prob/p152303
Given an array of strings, return a Map<String, Integer> containing a key for every 
different string in the array, always with the value 0. For example the string \"hello\" makes 
the pair \"hello\":0. We'll do more complicated counting later, but for this problem 
the value is simply 0.
